# Project 2
 
## Guide
  - [Project-3.ipynb](https://github.com/QijunYang1/Fintech-545/blob/main/week03/project3.ipynb) is my code
  - [Project3.pdf](https://github.com/QijunYang1/Fintech-545/blob/main/week03/week3.pdf) is my answer
 ## Ways to run my code
  - run the code in juypter notebook (`pip install jupyter notebook` on your terminal if you have not installed it.)
  - runipy .ipynb in your terminal (`pip3 install runipy` if you have not installed it.)
  - use ipython to run my code
